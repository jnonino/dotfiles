To activate these completions, add the following to your .zshrc:

  if type brew &>/dev/null; then

  fi

You may also need to force rebuild `zcompdump`:

  rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit

Additionally, if you receive "zsh compinit: insecure directories" warnings when attempting

  chmod go-w '/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/share'
  chmod -R go-w '/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/share/zsh'
